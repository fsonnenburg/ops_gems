        is metabolized primarily in the liver, undergoing oxidative metabolism, mediated
        by CYP3A4, as well as glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Sorafenib accounts
        for approximately 70-85% of the circulating analytes in plasma at steady-
        state. Eight metabolites of sorafenib have been identified, of which five
        have been detected in plasma. The main circulating metabolite of sorafenib
        in plasma, the pyridine N-oxide, shows <i>in vitro</i> potency similar to
        that of sorafenib. This metabolite comprises approximately 9-16% of circulating
        analytes at steady-state.","description":"Sorafenib (rINN), marketed as Nexavar
        by Bayer, is a drug approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma
        (primary kidney cancer). It has also received \"Fast Track\" designation by
        the FDA for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver
        cancer), and has since performed well in Phase III trials.\nSorafenib is a
        small molecular inhibitor of Raf kinase, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor),
        VEGF receptor 2 & 3 kinases and c Kit the receptor for Stem cell factor. A
        growing number of drugs target most of these pathways. The originality of
        Sorafenib lays in its simultaneous targeting of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway.","proteinBinding":"99.5%","toxicity":"The
        highest dose of sorafenib studied clinically is 800 mg twice daily. The adverse
        reactions observed at this dose were primarily diarrhea and dermatologic events.
        No information is available on symptoms of acute overdose in animals because
        of the saturation of absorption in oral acute toxicity studies conducted in
        animals."},"http://rdf.chemspider.com/187440",{"_about":"http://www.conceptwiki.org/concept/38932552-111f-4a4e-a46a-4ed1d7bdf9d5","inDataset":"http://www.conceptwiki.org","prefLabel":"Sorafenib"}],"isPrimaryTopicOf":"http://api.openphacts.org/compound.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Frdf.chemspider.com%2F187440"}}}'
